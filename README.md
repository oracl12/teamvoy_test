2 main modes of work:
1. Exact search which are looking for 100% matches(doesnt support exclusion)
2. Relevant search which allows you to write some words in incorrect way,
    this regime supports different precisions: the less precision - the more variants will be found(supports exclusion)

Results are updating on any change of changable fields

## P.S.
I hadnt use any additional gems except gem responsible for calculating distance between words
